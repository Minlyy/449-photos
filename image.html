        <p class="detail">Prince Jarvan, scion of the Lightshield dynasty, is heir apparent to the throne of Demacia. 
            Raised to be a paragon of his nation's greatest virtues, he is forced to balance the heavy 
            expectations placed upon him with his own desire to fight on the front lines. Jarvan inspires 
            his troops with his fearsome courage and selfless determination, raising his family's colors high 
            and revealing his true strength as a future leader of his people.
